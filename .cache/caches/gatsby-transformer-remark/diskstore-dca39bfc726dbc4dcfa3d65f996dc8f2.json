To give a quick introduction about typescript for those who don’t know, typescript is a pre-processor language to Javascript. Due to its nature you can build additional tools into the language such as type safety to benefit the developer/developers when coding. It also comes with its own compiler and linting to further aid in making the project consistent.","position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":2,"column":427,"offset":427}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":2,"column":427,"offset":427}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"I have found that Typescript is a massive aid when used in big projects. Recently at Codeweavers we have been converting a project that has been on AngularJS 1.3 and still uses JQuery into a AngularJS 1.6 and RxJS ball of happiness. Of course there have been issues, mainly due module bundling issues. Since converting the project over, the project has received less bugs and is easier to develop in.
