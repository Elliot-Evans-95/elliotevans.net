It feels great to finally flex (pun intended) my skills on the CSS layout front and create near pixel perfect designs. I feel when doing so I am still not getting the most of out it, as on the horizon is CSS Grid. fortunately and unfortunately I have used it: fortunately I have used it because its a great way of styling layout. The names are intuitive and the ‘grid-template-area’ is a great way of defining where classes/elements should be on the page, it reduces file size considerably, I find it to be 90% reduction in size. I have unfortunately used it because I know how good CSS layout can be, the ‘@support’ in CSS is not what i would like it to be and it results is more frustration having to flex everything on the page, which could lead to a slower page responsiveness.
