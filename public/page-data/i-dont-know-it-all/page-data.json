Failure is often pictured with a sense of sadness and greater consequences such as being fired or\nmaking a project ‘unsuccessful’ but should not be the case.</p>\n<p>Failure is not something to be ashamed of, the greatest way to learn is to try and learn from your mistakes so go and\ndiscover and learn about what you want to fail at. Maybe it's the stigma that you have to be all knowing so you can type\nthat keyword down on your CV or look good on public sites because you have done this already. As a community we should\nbe honest with each other and only say what we know.</p>\n<p>An excellent post in conjunction which prompted this post was made by Dan Abramov\ncalled <a href=\"https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/\">https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/</a> which Dan who many look up to as a source of inspiration or\nthe fountain of knoledge explained what he didn’t know. This post really opened my eyes, you don’t have to be\nall-knowing, just learn what you want to focus on that particular thing.</p>\n<p>If you can be good at this one thing (lets say React for example) you can be a “great” developer. So this merges with\nthe concept of learning from failure too. DOn’t be scared to admit things and try and learn what you want to learn.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"I don’t know it all","date":"01 May, 2019","intro":""},"timeToRead":1},"allFile":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"f65f7008-4ad0-59fa-89b8-6c5f8b3ea230","childSiteJson":{"id":"18a4403d-af10-5ad2-802f-b0a75fb71641","header":{"icon":"../assets/images/header-icon.webp","heading":"Elliot Evans"}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/i-dont-know-it-all/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
